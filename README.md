## Obsidian-Excalidraw
The Obsidian-Excalidraw plugin integrates [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), a feature rich sketching tool, into Obsidian. You can store and edit Excalidraw files in your vault and you can transclude drawings into your documents. For a showcase of Excalidraw features please read my blog post [here](https://www.zsolt.blog/2021/03/showcasing-excalidraw.html).

### Key features
- The plugin adds 3 commands to the command palette. 1) To create a new drawing. 2) To find and edit existing drawings in your vault, and 3) to transclude a drawing into a document.
- You can also use the file explorer in your vault to open Excalidraw files.
- You can set up a default folder for your drawings in Settings this is where new drawings will be saved. 
- You can set up a Template by creating a drawing, customizing it the way you like it, and specifying the file as the template in settings.
- Drawings are saved to your vault as a file with the extension ".excalidraw".
- You can set the size of embedded image using the [[image.excalidraw|100]] or [[image.excalidraw|100x100]] format.

### How to?
- Add a library: Click [browse libraries](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/?target=_excalidraw&sort=default) in Excalidraw. Download the preferred library and close browser tab. Click Load library in Excalidraw-Obsidian to load your locally saved library.

### Known issues
- When inserting images from the library, in some cases these images will be placed out of view. You'll need to select scroll to view at the bottom of the screen. The bug was reproduced by the Excalidraw development team, and will be resolved in the next update of Excalidraw.
- On iPad: As you draw left to right it opens left sidebar. Draw right to left, opens right sidebar. Draw down it opens commands palette. So seems open is emulating the gestures, even when drawing towards the center. This will be resolved in the next release according to Licat.
