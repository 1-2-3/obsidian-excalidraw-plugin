## Obsidian-Excalidraw
The Obsidian-Excalidraw plugin integrates [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), a feature rich sketching tool, into Obsidian. You can store and edit Excalidraw files in your vault and you can transclude drawings into your documents. For a showcase of Excalidraw features, please read my blog post [here](https://www.zsolt.blog/2021/03/showcasing-excalidraw.html).

### Key features
- The plugin adds 3 commands to the command palette. 1) To create a new drawing. 2) To find and edit existing drawings in your vault, and 3) to transclude a drawing into a document.
- You can also use the file explorer in your vault to open Excalidraw files.
- You can set up a default folder for saving new drawings in Settings. 
- You can set up a Template by creating a drawing, customizing it the way you like it, and specifying the file as the template in settings.
- The plugin saves drawings to your vault as a file with the .excalidraw file-extension.
- You can set the size of embedded image using the [[image.excalidraw|100]] or [[image.excalidraw|100x100]] format.

### How to?
- Add a library: Click [browse libraries](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/?target=_excalidraw&sort=default) in Excalidraw. Download the preferred library and close browser tab. Click Load library in Excalidraw-Obsidian to load your locally saved library.

### Known issues
- When inserting images from the library, sometimes these images appear out of view. You’ll need to select “scroll to view” at the bottom of the screen. This is a bug in Excalidraw. The Excalidraw development team has successfully reproduced the bug and promised to resolve it in the next update of Excalidraw.
- On iPad: As you draw left to right it opens left sidebar. Draw right to left, opens right sidebar. Draw down, opens commands palette. So seems open is emulating the gestures, even when drawing towards the center. I have raised the problem with the Obsidian.md team, and Licat promised to resolve this issue in the next Obsidian release.
