The Excalidraw Obsidian plugin is much more than "just" a drawing tool. To help you get started here's a showcase of the key Excalidraw plugin features.

If you'd like to learn more, please subscribe to my YouTube channel: [Visual PKM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC0gns4a9fhVkGkngvSumAQ) where I regularly share videos about Obsidian-Excalidraw and about tools and techniques for Visual Personal Knowledge Management.

Thank you & Enjoy!

Intro: `I want to make it easier for you to keep up with all the updates.
Going forward, after installing each release, you'll be prompted with a message summarizing the key new features and fixes.
You can disable this in plugin-settings. The release change log is also avalable on [GitHub](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases).

Since March 2021, I've spent most of my free time building this plugin. By now, this means well over 100 workdays worth of my time (assuming 8-hour days).
I am greatful to all of you who have already bought me a coffee. THANK YOU! This means a lot to me!

I still have many-many ideas for making Obsidian Excalidraw better.
I will continue to keep all the features of the plugin free. If, however, you'd like to contribute to the on-going development of the plugin, I am introducing a simple membership scheme, with Insider, Supporter and VIP tiers.

## Fixed
- CMD+Drag does not work on Mac. You can now use SHIFT+Drag to embed an image or markdown document from the file Obsidian File Explorer into a scene.
- If you hold down SHIFT while resizing a sticky note, the text size will scale, instead of text wrapping.
